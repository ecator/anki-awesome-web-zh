AwesomeTTS can also be used to remove [sound] tags and audio  paths from notes you select in the browser.

## Instructions

1.  From the card browser, highlight the cards whose notes have audio that      you would like to remove.
2.  From the &ldquo;AwesomeTTS&rdquo; menu, select &ldquo;Remove Audio      from Selected&rdquo;.
3.  Check the fields that you want AwesomeTTS to scan for the audio.
4.  Indicate what kind of audio you want to remove.
        *   _only [sound] tags or paths generated by AwesomeTTS_              will only remove audio that you created using the AwesomeTTS              add-on
    *   _only [sound] tags not generated by AwesomeTTS_ will              only remove audio that you either created manually or with the              help of another add-on
    *   _all [sound] tags, regardless of origin, and paths              generated by AwesomeTTS_ will remove any audio that              AwesomeTTS recognizes5.  Click &ldquo;Remove Now&rdquo; to begin processing.

### Hints

*   This feature is intended to be used to remove audio stored in your      collection, such as audio you might have added using AwesomeTTS in the      [note editor](editor.html) or [card browser](browser.html),      or even audio added independently of AwesomeTTS. This therefore does      _not_ cover [on-the-fly playback](on-the-fly.html), which      requires editing your card templates.
*   If you make a mistake, you can undo the changes by going to the Edit      menu and selecting the Undo AwesomeTTS Sound Removal option.
*   Removing audio from notes via this tool will not automatically remove      the physical audio files from your collection. To do that, use      Anki&rsquo;s &ldquo;Check Media&rdquo; option in the main window      &ldquo;Tools&rdquo; menu.
