You can use AwesomeTTS to just add or update audio files one-by-one.

This method, along with the [on-the-fly method](on-the-fly.html) or the on-demand [presets method](presets.html) might be easier.

## Instructions

 
- From the note editor, activate the input field to which you would like to add the audio <samp>[sound]</samp> tag. 
- Click the speaker icon in the toolbar. 
- Select your desired service and configure any options. 
- Confirm that the input phrase is correct. 
- Click &ldquo;Preview&rdquo; to confirm that your audio is as you would like it to sound. 
- Click &ldquo;Record&rdquo; to insert the audio clip in the field.

### Hints

 
- AwesomeTTS will automatically populate the input field of the note editor dialog with whatever was already in the active note field when you opened the dialog. If it was empty, AwesomeTTS will try to populate the input field with whatever is in the system clipboard. The options you set on the [Text tab of the configuration screen](/config/text.html) will apply to this. 
- [Mass removal of audio can be done via the card browser](removing.html) later if you decide you do not like the audio you have added to a set of notes. 
- The default keyboard shortcut to launch AwesomeTTS from the note editor dialog is <kbd>Ctrl+T</kbd> (or <kbd>Cmd+T</kbd> on Mac OS X.html), which overrides the default Anki shortcut key for LaTeX. If you want to restore the LaTeX shortcut key, you can [change this in AwesomeTTS&rsquo;s window configuration](/config/windows.html).
