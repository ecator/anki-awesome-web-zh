![AwesomeTTS configuration dialog with the Windows tab selected](/assets/images/config.windows.png)    &ldquo;Windows&rdquo; configuration tab

The &ldquo;Windows&rdquo; tab allows the user to see and change the  shortcuts available to launch various windows throughout Anki while using  the add-on.

AwesomeTTS comes installed by default with most windows responding to  Ctrl+T (or Cmd+T on Mac OS X), but users may be  interested in changing or removing a shortcut if there is a conflict with  another feature (e.g. LaTeX in the note editor.html) or installed add-on that  they use.

## Available Window Shortcuts

*   [open configuration in main      window](/config)
*   [insert &lt;tts&gt; tag in      template editor](/usage/on-the-fly.html)
*   [mass generate MP3s in card browser](/usage/browser.html)
*   [mass remove audio in card browser](/usage/removing.html)
*   [generate single MP3 in note editor](/usage/editor.html)

For all of these, clicking on the associated shortcut button and then  striking a key (e.g. F10) or key combination (e.g.  Ctrl+F10) will change the shortcut used to open that window.

## Additional Tips

    `{{! n.b. Some of these are present but reworded on the Playback tab. }}`*   If you already have the card browser or an editor window open when      changing a shortcut, it will not take effect until the next time that      window is reopened.
*   Changing a shortcut to one that is already used by a native Anki      feature or already reserved by another add-on may not work, depending      on exactly what you set for what. Some experimentation may be necessary      to arrive at a comfortable configuration.
*   To unset an window shortcut altogether, you can click its button and      then strike either Backspace or Delete.
*   To set multiple shortcuts at the same time to the same key or key      combination, you can click both buttons and then strike your desired      shortcut once. All shortcuts will be set simultaneously.
*   While setting a shortcut, you can strike Escape to cancel      and revert back to what the shortcut was before you clicked the      button.
*   Some keys are reserved and cannot be used in shortcuts.
