Whether you want to play audio on-the-fly or store MP3s with your  collection, AwesomeTTS can be configured in various ways to suit different  users.

To reach the configuration screen, go to the main window in Anki, open the  Tools menu, and select AwesomeTTS. By default, the  configuration screen can also be quickly reached using Ctrl+T  (or Cmd+T on Mac OS X) whenever the main window is open.

Please note that unlike most Anki preferences, as of the current version of  AwesomeTTS, your configuration is local to the computer you install it on  and it applies to all of your decks. Any settings you make will not be  synchronized between different computers and there is currently no way to  apply different settings to different decks.
