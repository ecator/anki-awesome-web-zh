SVOX Pico is a small-footprint text-to-speech engine distributed with the  Android operating system, but it can also be run on Linux and other POSIX  systems.

Supported languages include:

*   English (British, American)
*   French
*   German
*   Italian

## Requirements

AwesomeTTS must be able to find the `pico2wave` binary (or,  alternatively, the same binary under the name `lt-pico2wave`) in  your system `$PATH`.

Some Linux distributions have packages available for SVOX Pico. Debian and  Ubuntu users can install it via the libttspico-utils package, and  Arch Linux users can find it on the AUR under svox-pico-git.
