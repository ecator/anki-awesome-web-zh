[Howjsay](http://www.howjsay.com/) is  an online service offering high-quality pronunciations of most common English  words, including many loanwords commonly used in English.

Please note that this service generally supports single words only and  **cannot be used to speak arbitrary sentences or phrases**.  Because of this, you may want to use Howjsay as [part  of a **in-order** service group](/usage/groups.html) so that you can fallback to  [another service](/services) when Howjsay does not  have audio for your input.

## Requirements

An Internet connection is required to use Howjsay from AwesomeTTS, but no  special software needs to be installed and it can be used from any operating  system.

Because Howjsay is a public Internet service, mass generation of MP3s using  the [tool in the Card Browser](/usage/browser.html) is rate-limited.  If you would like to tweak this behavior for your installation of  AwesomeTTS, go to the [MP3s configuration tab](/config/mp3s.html) and  look for the &ldquo;Download Throttling&rdquo; settings.
