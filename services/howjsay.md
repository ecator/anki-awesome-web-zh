# Howjsay

<!-- [Howjsay](http://www.howjsay.com/) is  an online service offering high-quality pronunciations of most common English  words, including many loanwords commonly used in English. -->

[Howjsay](http://www.howjsay.com/)是一个在线生成英语单词发音的网站。

<!-- Please note that this service generally supports single words only and  **cannot be used to speak arbitrary sentences or phrases**.  Because of this, you may want to use Howjsay as [part  of a **in-order** service group](/usage/groups.html) so that you can fallback to  [another service](/services) when Howjsay does not  have audio for your input. -->

请注意Howjsay只支持单个单词发音，**所以不要用它来试图获取句子的发音**。如果你想获取句子的发音请参考[其他语音服务](/services.html) :point_right:

<!-- ## Requirements -->

## 要求

<!-- An Internet connection is required to use Howjsay from AwesomeTTS, but no  special software needs to be installed and it can be used from any operating  system. -->

只需要有网就行啦:clap:不需要安装其他软件。

<!-- Because Howjsay is a public Internet service, mass generation of MP3s using  the [tool in the Card Browser](/usage/browser.html) is rate-limited.  If you would like to tweak this behavior for your installation of  AwesomeTTS, go to the [MP3s configuration tab](/config/mp3s.html) and  look for the &ldquo;Download Throttling&rdquo; settings. -->

因为Howjsay是一个公共网络服务，[在浏览器中用AwesomeTTS工具](/usage/browser.html)批量生成音频有频率限制，如果你想改变这个限制请移步[音频配置标签](/config/mp3s.html)，然后你会看到“下载限制”这个设置。
