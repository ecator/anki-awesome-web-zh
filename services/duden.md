<p><a href="http://www.duden.de" rel="external noreferrer">Duden</a> is an
  online dictionary with high-quality pronunciations of many common German
  words.</p>

<p>Please note that this service generally supports single words only and
  <strong>cannot be used to speak arbitrary sentences or phrases</strong>.
  Because of this, you may want to use Duden as <a href="/usage/groups">part
  of a <strong>in-order</strong> service group</a> so that you can fallback to
  <a href="/services" rel="parent">another service</a> when Duden does not
  have audio for your input.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>An Internet connection is required to use Duden from AwesomeTTS, but no
  special software needs to be installed and it can be used from any operating
  system.</p>

<p>Because Duden is a public Internet service, mass generation of MP3s using
  the <a href="/usage/browser">tool in the Card Browser</a> is rate-limited.
  In addition, Duden is rate-limited by <strong>a variable amount</strong>
  depending on what you search for (at least three times that of other
  Internet-based services because Duden requires at least three requests for
  every word searched). If you would like to tweak this behavior for your
  installation of AwesomeTTS, go to the <a href="/config/mp3s">MP3s
  configuration tab</a> and look for the &ldquo;Download Throttling&rdquo;
  settings.</p>
