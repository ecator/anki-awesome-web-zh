[Duden](http://www.duden.de) is an  online dictionary with high-quality pronunciations of many common German  words.

Please note that this service generally supports single words only and  <strong>cannot be used to speak arbitrary sentences or phrases</strong>.  Because of this, you may want to use Duden as [part  of a <strong>in-order</strong> service group](/usage/groups.html) so that you can fallback to  [another service](/services.html) when Duden does not  have audio for your input.

## Requirements

An Internet connection is required to use Duden from AwesomeTTS, but no  special software needs to be installed and it can be used from any operating  system.

Because Duden is a public Internet service, mass generation of MP3s using  the [tool in the Card Browser](/usage/browser.html) is rate-limited.  In addition, Duden is rate-limited by <strong>a variable amount</strong>  depending on what you search for (at least three times that of other  Internet-based services because Duden requires at least three requests for  every word searched). If you would like to tweak this behavior for your  installation of AwesomeTTS, go to the [MP3s  configuration tab](/config/mp3s.html) and look for the &ldquo;Download Throttling&rdquo;  settings.
