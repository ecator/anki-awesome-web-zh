<!-- [Duden](http://www.duden.de) is an  online dictionary with high-quality pronunciations of many common German  words. -->

[杜登-Duden](http://www.duden.de)是一个可以在线生成德语发音的词典。

<!-- Please note that this service generally supports single words only and  <strong>cannot be used to speak arbitrary sentences or phrases</strong>.  Because of this, you may want to use Duden as [part  of a <strong>in-order</strong> service group](/usage/groups.html) so that you can fallback to  [another service](/services.html) when Duden does not  have audio for your input. -->

请注意本服务只支持单个单词发音，**所以不要用它来试图获取句子的发音**。如果你想获取句子的发音请参考[其他语音服务](/services.html) :point_right:

<!-- ## Requirements -->

## 要求

<!-- An Internet connection is required to use Duden from AwesomeTTS, but no  special software needs to be installed and it can be used from any operating  system. -->

只需要有网就行啦:clap:不需要安装其他软件。

<!-- Because Duden is a public Internet service, mass generation of MP3s using  the [tool in the Card Browser](/usage/browser.html) is rate-limited.  In addition, Duden is rate-limited by <strong>a variable amount</strong>  depending on what you search for (at least three times that of other  Internet-based services because Duden requires at least three requests for  every word searched). If you would like to tweak this behavior for your  installation of AwesomeTTS, go to the [MP3s  configuration tab](/config/mp3s.html) and look for the &ldquo;Download Throttling&rdquo;  settings. -->

因为Duden是一个公共网络服务，[在浏览器中用AwesomeTTS工具](/usage/browser.html)批量生成音频有频率限制，实际上每个单词查询会请求三次，如果你想改变这个限制请移步[音频配置标签](/config/mp3s.html)，然后你会看到“下载限制”这个设置。
