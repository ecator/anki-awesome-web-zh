[Fluency.nl](http://www.fluency.nl) is  an online text-to-speech demo offering several voices for the Dutch  language.

## Requirements

An Internet connection is required to use Fluency.nl from AwesomeTTS in  addition to having `mplayer` available. Fluency.nl is available  on all operating systems.

Because Fluency.nl is a public Internet service, mass generation of MP3s  using the [tool in the Card Browser](/usage/browser.html) is  rate-limited. If you would like to tweak the rate-limiting behavior for your  installation of AwesomeTTS, go to the [MP3s  configuration tab](/config/mp3s.html) and look for the &ldquo;Download Throttling&rdquo;  settings.
