<p><a href="http://www.fluency.nl" rel="external noreferrer">Fluency.nl</a> is
  an online text-to-speech demo offering several voices for the Dutch
  language.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>An Internet connection is required to use Fluency.nl from AwesomeTTS in
  addition to having <code>mplayer</code> available. Fluency.nl is available
  on all operating systems.</p>

<p>Because Fluency.nl is a public Internet service, mass generation of MP3s
  using the <a href="/usage/browser">tool in the Card Browser</a> is
  rate-limited. If you would like to tweak the rate-limiting behavior for your
  installation of AwesomeTTS, go to the <a href="/config/mp3s">MP3s
  configuration tab</a> and look for the &ldquo;Download Throttling&rdquo;
  settings.</p>
