### Why aren&rsquo;t all of Google Translate&rsquo;s languages listed?

Google Translate only offers text-to-speech support for a subset of all the  languages it can translate. While most very popular languages are supported  with text-to-speech, some other languages are translate-only.

If you notice that Google Translate on the web displays a speaker icon for  a language not listed within AwesomeTTS, please [let us  know](/contribute).

## Requirements

An Internet connection is required to use Google Translate from  AwesomeTTS, but no special software needs to be installed and it can be used  from any operating system.

Because Google Translate is a public Internet service, mass generation of  MP3s using the [tool in the Card Browser](/usage/browser.html) is  rate-limited. It is not recommended that you send too many requests to this  service.

### I cannot access Google Translate, but I can access other online TTS  services. What might cause this?

In some regions, access to Google services is blocked. Despite this, some  users report success with services like [Astrill VPN](//www.astrill.com) to download audio from Google Translate.  When selecting and setting up such services, please note that browser-only  solutions (like Astrill&rsquo;s &ldquo;OpenWeb&rdquo; protocol) might not  work from inside Anki. Users might have better luck with full-system  solutions (like Astrill&rsquo;s &ldquo;OpenVPN&rdquo; protocol).

Depending on the language you are learning,  [another service](/services) might be a good  alternative to Google.
