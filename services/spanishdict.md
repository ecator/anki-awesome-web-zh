[SpanishDict](http://www.spanishdict.com/)  is an online dictionary for translating and conjugating Spanish and English.  The site offers text-to-speech for both languages.

## Requirements

An Internet connection is required to use SpanishDict from AwesomeTTS, but  no special software needs to be installed and it can be used from any  operating system.

Because SpanishDict is a public Internet service, mass generation of MP3s  using the [tool in the Card Browser](/usage/browser.html) is  rate-limited. If you would like to tweak this behavior for your installation  of AwesomeTTS, go to the [MP3s configuration tab](/config/mp3s.html)  and look for the &ldquo;Download Throttling&rdquo; settings.
