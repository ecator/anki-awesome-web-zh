<p><a href="http://www.spanishdict.com/" rel="external noreferrer">SpanishDict</a>
  is an online dictionary for translating and conjugating Spanish and English.
  The site offers text-to-speech for both languages.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>An Internet connection is required to use SpanishDict from AwesomeTTS, but
  no special software needs to be installed and it can be used from any
  operating system.</p>

<p>Because SpanishDict is a public Internet service, mass generation of MP3s
  using the <a href="/usage/browser">tool in the Card Browser</a> is
  rate-limited. If you would like to tweak this behavior for your installation
  of AwesomeTTS, go to the <a href="/config/mp3s">MP3s configuration tab</a>
  and look for the &ldquo;Download Throttling&rdquo; settings.</p>
