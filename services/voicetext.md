[VoiceText](http://voicetext.jp) is an  online text-to-speech service offering playback in Japanese in several  voices. Users can adjust the emotion, speed, pitch, and volume of the output  when using VoiceText.

## Requirements

An Internet connection is required to use VoiceText from AwesomeTTS, but no  special software needs to be installed and it can be used from any operating  system.

Access to the VoiceText API is shared among all AwesomeTTS users, and these  resources are limited. Because of these limits, mass generation of MP3s using  the [tool in the Card Browser](/usage/browser.html) is rate-limited. It  is recommended that you use the default rate-limiting settings in your  [MP3s configuration tab](/config/mp3s.html)&rsquo; &ldquo;Download  Throttling&rdquo; section (10 operations per 30 seconds) and that you limit  your daily usage of the service.
