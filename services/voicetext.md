<p><a href="http://voicetext.jp" rel="external noreferrer">VoiceText</a> is an
  online text-to-speech service offering playback in Japanese in several
  voices. Users can adjust the emotion, speed, pitch, and volume of the output
  when using VoiceText.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>An Internet connection is required to use VoiceText from AwesomeTTS, but no
  special software needs to be installed and it can be used from any operating
  system.</p>

<p>Access to the VoiceText API is shared among all AwesomeTTS users, and these
  resources are limited. Because of these limits, mass generation of MP3s using
  the <a href="/usage/browser">tool in the Card Browser</a> is rate-limited. It
  is recommended that you use the default rate-limiting settings in your
  <a href="/config/mp3s">MP3s configuration tab</a>&rsquo; &ldquo;Download
  Throttling&rdquo; section (10 operations per 30 seconds) and that you limit
  your daily usage of the service.</p>
