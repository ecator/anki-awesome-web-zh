# 维基词典

<!-- [Wiktionary](http://www.wiktionary.org)  is an online dictionary for several languages with limited spoken words. -->

[维基词典](http://www.wiktionary.org)是一个支持多钟语言的在线词典。

<!-- Because Wiktionary has a very limited set of spoken words, you may want to  use it as [part of a service group](/usage/groups.html) so that you can  fallback to [another service](/services) when  Wiktionary does not have audio for your input. -->

<!-- ## Requirements -->

## 要求

<!-- An Internet connection is required to use Wiktionary from AwesomeTTS in  addition to having `mplayer` and `lame` available.  Wiktionary is available on all operating systems except Mac OS X, which  lacks a way to convert the OGG files Wiktionary uses. -->

只需要有网就行啦:clap:但是不支持Mac平台，因为Mac不能转换维基词典使用的OGG文件。

<!-- Because Wiktionary is a public Internet service, mass generation of MP3s  using the [tool in the Card Browser](/usage/browser.html) is  rate-limited. In addition, Wiktionary is rate-limited by **twice the  amount** of most of the other Internet-based services because  Wiktionary requires two requests for every word. If you would like to tweak  the rate-limiting behavior for your installation of AwesomeTTS, go to the  [MP3s configuration tab](/config/mp3s.html) and look for the  &ldquo;Download Throttling&rdquo; settings. -->

VoiceText对所有AwesomeTTS用户开放，但是[在浏览器中用AwesomeTTS工具](/usage/browser.html)批量生成音频有频率限制，如果你想改变这个限制请移步[音频配置标签](/config/mp3s.html)，然后你会看到“下载限制”这个设置。
