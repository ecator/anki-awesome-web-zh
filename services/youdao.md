<p>The <a href="http://dict.youdao.com" rel="external noreferrer">Youdao
  Dictionary</a> is an online service with high-quality human-spoken
  pronunciations of most common English words, with computer-generated speech
  for other input phrases.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>An Internet connection is required to use Youdao from AwesomeTTS, but no
  special software needs to be installed and it can be used from any operating
  system.</p>

<p>Because Youdao is a public Internet service, mass generation of MP3s using
  the <a href="/usage/browser">tool in the Card Browser</a> is rate-limited.
  If you would like to tweak this behavior for your installation of AwesomeTTS,
  go to the <a href="/config/mp3s">MP3s configuration tab</a> and look for the
  &ldquo;Download Throttling&rdquo; settings.</p>
