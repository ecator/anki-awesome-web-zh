The [Youdao  Dictionary](http://dict.youdao.com) is an online service with high-quality human-spoken  pronunciations of most common English words, with computer-generated speech  for other input phrases.

## Requirements

An Internet connection is required to use Youdao from AwesomeTTS, but no  special software needs to be installed and it can be used from any operating  system.

Because Youdao is a public Internet service, mass generation of MP3s using  the [tool in the Card Browser](/usage/browser.html) is rate-limited.  If you would like to tweak this behavior for your installation of AwesomeTTS,  go to the [MP3s configuration tab](/config/mp3s.html) and look for the  &ldquo;Download Throttling&rdquo; settings.
