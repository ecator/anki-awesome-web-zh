The [Collins Dictionary](http://www.collinsdictionary.com) is an online reference site that has high-quality human pronunciation of most common English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Chinese words.

Please note that this service generally supports single words only and <strong>cannot be used to speak arbitrary sentences or phrases</strong>. Because of this, you may want to use Collins as [part of a <strong>in-order</strong> service group](/usage/groups.html) so that you can fallback to [another service](/services.html) when Collins does not have audio for your input.

## Requirements

An Internet connection is required to use Collins from AwesomeTTS, but no special software needs to be installed and it can be used from any operating system.

Because Collins is a public Internet service, mass generation of MP3s using the [tool in the Card Browser](/usage/browser.html) is rate-limited. In addition, each word lookup on the Collins Dictionary requires two requests to fulfill. If you would like to tweak this behavior for your installation of AwesomeTTS, go to the [MP3s configuration tab](/config/mp3s.html) and look for the &ldquo;Download Throttling&rdquo; settings.
