 &ldquo;Add TTS Audio to Note&rdquo; dialog with the Baidu Translate service activated

## Requirements

An Internet connection is required to use Baidu Translate from AwesomeTTS, but no special software needs to be installed and it can be used from any operating system.

Because Baidu Translate is a public Internet service, mass generation of MP3s using the [tool in the Card Browser](/usage/browser.html) is rate-limited. If you would like to tweak this behavior for your installation of AwesomeTTS, go to the [MP3s configuration tab](/config/mp3s.html) and look for the &ldquo;Download Throttling&rdquo; settings.
