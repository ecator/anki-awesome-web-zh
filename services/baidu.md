<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>An Internet connection is required to use Baidu Translate from AwesomeTTS,
  but no special software needs to be installed and it can be used from any
  operating system.</p>

<p>Because Baidu Translate is a public Internet service, mass generation of
  MP3s using the <a href="/usage/browser">tool in the Card Browser</a> is
  rate-limited. If you would like to tweak this behavior for your installation
  of AwesomeTTS, go to the <a href="/config/mp3s">MP3s configuration tab</a>
  and look for the &ldquo;Download Throttling&rdquo; settings.</p>
