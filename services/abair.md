[abair.ie](http://www.abair.tcd.ie) is  an online text-to-speech synthesizer offering high-quality playback in  various Irish voices, which originated from a university research  project.

## Requirements

An Internet connection is required to use abair.ie from AwesomeTTS, but no  special software needs to be installed and it can be used from any operating  system.

Because abair.ie is a public Internet service, mass generation of MP3s using  the [tool in the Card Browser](/usage/browser.html) is rate-limited. If  you would like to tweak this behavior for your installation of AwesomeTTS, go  to the [MP3s configuration tab](/config/mp3s.html) and look for the  &ldquo;Download Throttling&rdquo; settings.
