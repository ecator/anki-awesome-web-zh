## Requirements

An Internet connection is required to use Oddcast from AwesomeTTS in  addition to having `mplayer` available. Oddcast is available on  all operating systems.

Because Oddcast is a public Internet service, mass generation of MP3s using  the [tool in the Card Browser](/usage/browser.html) is rate-limited.  If you would like to tweak the rate-limiting behavior for your installation  of AwesomeTTS, go to the [MP3s configuration tab](/config/mp3s.html)  and look for the &ldquo;Download Throttling&rdquo; settings.
