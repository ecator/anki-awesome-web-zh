[NAVER  Translate](http://translate.naver.com) is an free online translation service that also offers  text-to-speech in some of it translation languages. Currently, it supports  Korean, English, Japanese, and Chinese.

## Requirements

An Internet connection is required to use NAVER from AwesomeTTS, but no  special software needs to be installed and it can be used from any operating  system.

Because NAVER Translate is a public Internet service, mass generation of  MP3s using the [tool in the Card Browser](/usage/browser.html) is  rate-limited. In addition, most voices in NAVER are rate-limited by  **twice the amount** of other Internet-based services because  NAVER requires two requests for every string of text. If you would like to  tweak the rate-limiting behavior for your installation of AwesomeTTS, go to  the [MP3s configuration tab](/config/mp3s.html) and look for the  &ldquo;Download Throttling&rdquo; settings.
