[NeoSpeech](http://neospeech.com) is an  online text-to-speech service with playback in the following languages:

*   Chinese
*   English (American and British)
*   French (Canadian)
*   Japanese
*   Korean
*   Spanish (Mexican)

## Requirements

An Internet connection is required to use NeoSpeech from AwesomeTTS in  addition to having `mplayer` available. NeoSpeech is available on  all operating systems.

Because NeoSpeech is a public Internet service, mass generation of MP3s  using the [tool in the Card Browser](/usage/browser.html) is  rate-limited. In addition, NeoSpeech is rate-limited by **twice the  amount** of other Internet-based services because NeoSpeech requires  two requests for every string of text. If you would like to tweak the  rate-limiting behavior for your installation of AwesomeTTS, go to the  [MP3s configuration tab](/config/mp3s.html) and look for the  &ldquo;Download Throttling&rdquo; settings.
