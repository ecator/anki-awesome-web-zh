The Speech Synthesis Manager, sometimes known as Say (after the  `say` command-line tool), is a built-in interface in  Apple&rsquo;s Mac OS X operating system to allow desktop programs like  AwesomeTTS access to voices for text-to-speech playback.

While Mac OS X comes built-in with the ability to use the Speech Synthesis  Manager, it usually only ships with one or a small handful of voices. You  can make additional voices available in the Speech Synthesis Manager by  downloading alternate voices in OS X&rsquo;s System Preferences. Supported  languages include:

*   Arabic
*   Chinese
*   Czech
*   Danish
*   Dutch
*   English
*   Finnish
*   French
*   German
*   Greek
*   Hindi
*   Hungarian
*   Indonesian
*   Italian
*   Japanese
*   Korean
*   Norwegian
*   Polish
*   Portuguese
*   Romanian
*   Russian
*   Slovak
*   Spanish
*   Swedish
*   Thai
*   Turkish
