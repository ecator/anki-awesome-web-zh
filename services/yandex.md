English, Spanish, and Portuguese playback from Yandex will feature a  European accent. If you are interested in an online service that offers  voices with an accent more like what is heard in the Americas, you may want  to try [another service](/services) instead.

## Requirements

An Internet connection is required to use Yandex.Translate from AwesomeTTS,  but no special software needs to be installed and it can be used from any  operating system.

Because Yandex.Translate is a public Internet service, mass generation of  MP3s using the [tool in the Card Browser](/usage/browser.html) is  rate-limited. If you would like to tweak this behavior for your installation  of AwesomeTTS, go to the [MP3s configuration tab](/config/mp3s.html)  and look for the &ldquo;Download Throttling&rdquo; settings.

## Options

When using Yandex.Translate, the **Quality** level can be  tweaked as one of the options. However, the difference in file size between  the two levels is negligible&mdash;and in some cases the &ldquo;low&rdquo;  quality level is actually larger in file size than the &ldquo;high&rdquo;  quality level&mdash;so it is recommended that users stick with the  &ldquo;high&rdquo; setting.
