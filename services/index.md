AwesomeTTS can provide text-to-speech playback from both Internet-based
  services as well as software installed on your computer.

When you first open an AwesomeTTS audio generation dialog during an Anki
  session, AwesomeTTS will try to automatically detect if you have any
  supported TTS software installed locally. If you do not see a particular
  service listed in the &ldquo;generate using&rdquo; dropdown menu, then
  AwesomeTTS either did not detect it or cannot communicate with it.

Note that if you decide to install new software to use with AwesomeTTS and
  Anki is already running, you may need to restart Anki before AwesomeTTS will
  see the newly-installed software. If after restarting, AwesomeTTS still does
  not detect your local TTS software, <a href="/contribute">please report
  it</a>.
