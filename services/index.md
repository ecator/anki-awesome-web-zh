# 语音服务

<!-- AwesomeTTS can provide text-to-speech playback from both Internet-based  services as well as software installed on your computer. -->

AwesomeTTS可以提供丰富的在线和本地语音服务。

<!-- When you first open an AwesomeTTS audio generation dialog during an Anki  session, AwesomeTTS will try to automatically detect if you have any  supported TTS software installed locally. If you do not see a particular  service listed in the &ldquo;generate using&rdquo; dropdown menu, then  AwesomeTTS either did not detect it or cannot communicate with it. -->

当你第一次使用AwesomeTTS生成语音的时候，AwesomeTTS会自动检测你的电脑是否安装了语音服务。


<!-- Note that if you decide to install new software to use with AwesomeTTS and  Anki is already running, you may need to restart Anki before AwesomeTTS will  see the newly-installed software. If after restarting, AwesomeTTS still does  not detect your local TTS software, [please report  it](/contribute.html). -->
