# iSpeech

<!-- [iSpeech](http://www.ispeech.org) is  an online speech platform that offers a text-to-speech API among its  offerings. Because it is online, iSpeech can be used on any operating  system.Unlike most online services AwesomeTTS integrates with, iSpeech requires  users to purchase an API key by visiting the iSpeech website and then  entering that API key into AwesomeTTS. Because users must pay to use it,  AwesomeTTS does not apply download throttling to it as it does other  Internet services.  iSpeech supports  [many different voice options](http://www.ispeech.org/api#49630ddd8394f977050dbc53df0f73c6a1fd9d0d),  including multiple dialects and speakers of popular languages. Additionally,  AwesomeTTS makes available the _speed_ and _pitch_ options  available from the API.   -->

[iSpeech](http://www.ispeech.org)是一个在线语音合成平台，因为这个平台是收费的，所以需要用户自己购买API密钥输入到AwesomeTTS中，并且没有下载限制，更多语言支持请参考[ispeech语音选项](http://www.ispeech.org/api#49630ddd8394f977050dbc53df0f73c6a1fd9d0d):confused:
