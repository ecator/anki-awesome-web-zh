# 牛津词典

<!-- The [Oxford  Dictionary](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com) is an online service with high-quality pronunciations of most  common English words. -->

[牛津词典](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com)是一个在线生成英语单词发音的网站。

<!-- Please note that this service generally supports single words only and  **cannot be used to speak arbitrary sentences or phrases**.  Because of this, you may want to use Oxford as [part  of a **in-order** service group](/usage/groups.html) so that you can fallback to  [another service](/services) when the Oxford  Dictionary does not have audio for your input. -->

请注意牛津词典只支持单个单词发音，**所以不要用它来试图获取句子的发音**。如果你想获取句子的发音请参考[其他语音服务](/services.html) :point_right:

<!-- ## Requirements -->

## 要求

<!-- An Internet connection is required to use Oxford from AwesomeTTS, but no  special software needs to be installed and it can be used from any operating  system. -->

只需要有网就行啦:clap:不需要安装其他软件。

<!-- Because Oxford is a public Internet service, mass generation of MP3s using  the [tool in the Card Browser](/usage/browser.html) is rate-limited.  In addition, the Oxford Dictionary is rate-limited by **twice the  amount** of other Internet-based services because Oxford requires two  requests for every word searched. If you would like to tweak this behavior  for your installation of AwesomeTTS, go to the [MP3s  configuration tab](/config/mp3s.html) and look for the &ldquo;Download Throttling&rdquo;  settings. -->

因为牛津词典是一个公共网络服务，[在浏览器中用AwesomeTTS工具](/usage/browser.html)批量生成音频有频率限制，如果你想改变这个限制请移步[音频配置标签](/config/mp3s.html)，然后你会看到“下载限制”这个设置。
