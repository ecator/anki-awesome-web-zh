The [Oxford  Dictionary](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com) is an online service with high-quality pronunciations of most  common English words.

Please note that this service generally supports single words only and  **cannot be used to speak arbitrary sentences or phrases**.  Because of this, you may want to use Oxford as [part  of a **in-order** service group](/usage/groups.html) so that you can fallback to  [another service](/services) when the Oxford  Dictionary does not have audio for your input.

## Requirements

An Internet connection is required to use Oxford from AwesomeTTS, but no  special software needs to be installed and it can be used from any operating  system.

Because Oxford is a public Internet service, mass generation of MP3s using  the [tool in the Card Browser](/usage/browser.html) is rate-limited.  In addition, the Oxford Dictionary is rate-limited by **twice the  amount** of other Internet-based services because Oxford requires two  requests for every word searched. If you would like to tweak this behavior  for your installation of AwesomeTTS, go to the [MP3s  configuration tab](/config/mp3s.html) and look for the &ldquo;Download Throttling&rdquo;  settings.
