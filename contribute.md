A wide range of people with different needs working with different  environments use AwesomeTTS. As such, there are always new features and bugs  that can crop up, and you can help AwesomeTTS&rsquo;s development by  reporting problems, making suggestions, writing code, testing new versions,  and rating the add-on.

## Reporting Bugs and Suggesting New Features

Users can report problems with the add-on and suggest new features by  opening a thread on [Anki&rsquo;s add-on support forum](//anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/add-ons). Registration is  optional.

For those with GitHub accounts, issues can also be opened directly on the  project&rsquo;s [repository issue tracker](//github.com/AwesomeTTS/AwesomeTTS/issues).

## Submitting Code and Pull Requests

Ongoing development happens on [AwesomeTTS&rsquo;s GitHub repository](//github.com/AwesomeTTS/AwesomeTTS). Interested  developers can download or clone the source code, make changes, and submit  pull requests there.

## Test Unreleased Versions

Follow the [installation instructions for other versions](install#other) to learn how to obtain unreleased versions of the add-on.

Note that AwesomeTTS&rsquo;s automatic update mechanism will not deliver  updates for unreleased versions of the add-on until they become official  stable released versions. If you are using Git, you can periodically use  <kbd>git pull</kbd> to obtain the latest version of the source code.

## Rate the Add-o

If you enjoy AwesomeTTS, consider leaving a rating on its  [AnkiWeb add-on  page](//ankiweb.net/shared/info/301952613). This helps other Anki users discover the add-on.

## Support the Projects on which AwesomeTTS Depends

Both Anki and many of the backend text-to-speech services that AwesomeTTS  integrates with are themselves free and open-source projects, often carried  out by volunteers. Depending on the specific project, you can help by  reporting problems, fixing bugs, and donating.
